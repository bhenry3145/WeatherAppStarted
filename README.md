You are to build out a weather app prototype for this week.

The weather app will be made where you are able to do the following:

Be able to search for and retrieve weather information for a specific location

Add that city to a list of favorites

On each search,  ability to see the following (how you achieve this is up to you)

Current weather at the time of the search

A general 5 day forecast

The ability to see max temp and min temp of the current day.

Ability to for data to persist when the user closes the browser and reopens the page

Desktop only build

Must be designed

Can use this for ideas: Some Ideas

Must pull api from https://openweathermap.org/

Peer Review: Chris Wells-Hott
Cooment: Great Job pull data from the APi and displaying it everything workd fine.We just have to figure out use the api key when its in the enviroment.js so it can work.Your code is clean and simple.good work.
